  [BEHAVIOR CHANGE]

    * the dbi backend now translates empty numeric fields into
      NULL fields.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * empty fields may now optionally be turned into NULL values.
      see the <nullify> attribute.

0.14      2018-03-21 13:03:45-04:00 America/New_York

  [API CHANGE]

    * dbi encoder:

      * The encoder no longer writes queued records at object
        destruction.  If there is an error writing a record to the
        database, an exception is raised. However, during object
        destruction Perl effectively ignores exceptions, suppressing
        notification of the failed writes.

      * if the record queue is not empty at the time of object destruction,
        a warning is issued.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * dbi encoder:

        * the encoder provides the <flush> method, which explicitly writes
          queued records to the database.

        * The record queue is available via the <queue> method.


0.13      2018-02-12 15:59:58-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * the rdb encoder warned if a field was undefined. it's now quiet.
    * the Data::Dumper encoder didn't output eval'able code when
      multiple records were written.

  [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    * update docs for JSON encoder to indicate that it is a
      stream of conactenated objects, and needs to be read
      with an incremental parser.


0.12      2017-06-15 15:43:52-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD]
    * require a recent version of Moo::Role to ensure that testers
      use one with which this code is compatible.
